## 🔥 Features

- Bypass multiple SSL pinning libraries on Android using XPosed framework api.
- included the most hooks available.

## ℹ️ First release note

- There is an issue in the module while loading new configs.
You have to restart it (SSL Killer) each time u added a new target app to the list so the hook will take effect.

1- add a target app.
2- restart the module (remove SSL Killer from recent apps then open again).
3- then click on start button.

That will fix the issue as temporary solution.
I will try to fix that in next versions ..

## 📋 Requirements

- XPosed Framework running on device (LSposed).
- Root access.
- For non-root users u can use VphoneGaga/VMos virtual machines with LSposed support.
